# Example: Using `node-sass` with `nodemon`

```
yarn run watch:styles
```

Recompiles Sass files any time a file changes within the `./styles` directory.

You may edit `node-sass-server.js` to configure any PostCSS options, or to add entrypoints and destination files.

I wanted to do this as a proof of concept without Gulp. Feel free to fork and give feedback.
